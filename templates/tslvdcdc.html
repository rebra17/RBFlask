                    During this project, a HV (588V) to LV (24V) isolated DCDC converter was designed. The project carried out over 4 months (1 semester).
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The primary and secondary-side topologies was selected as Full-bridge (FB)-FB with SiliconCarbide (SiC) 
                    and Gallium-Nitride (GaN) - technology respectively, based on the power
                    losses and transformer utilisation.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Planar transformer and inductor was designed, in
                    order to minimise the height of the final PCB and to be able to control parasitic parameters as tightly as possible. 
                    Filters, snubber-circuit, ICL and other protection was
                    implemented to ensure the reliability of the converter and the peak-efficiency was derived
                    to 96.03% at nominal voltage at a switching frequency of 200kHz.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The final PCB was designed and a power density 
                    was determined to be 0.8638kW Lâˆ’1, which was relatively low, mainly due to the low power output.
