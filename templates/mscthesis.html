                    During this project, the optimal topology for the application is determined and a solution
                    for the energy storage system is determined. The proposed topology is a Dual Active Bridge
                    converter, and the proposed energy solution consists of a supercapacitor bank with high current
                    capabilities and energy density. The proposed energy solution can quickly be charged and
                    discharged, which fits the application well.

                    A Dual Active Bridge converter rated for 1kW output
                    power is designed with reliability in mind. The inductor is integrated into the transformer by
                    designing the transformer with a large leakage inductance. An analogue peak-current mode
                    controller is designed and implemented for inherent over-current protection. The controller is
                    capable of operating in both directions of power-flow as well as controlling the direction of
                    power-flow. A discrete logic circuitry is proposed for controlling the converter state as well as
                    detecting faults and deactivating the system.
